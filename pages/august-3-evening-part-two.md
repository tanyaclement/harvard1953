This recording from August 3 is a continuation of <a href="https://github.com/tanyaclement/harvard1953/edit/gh-pages/pages/august-3-evening-part-two.md">the first part</a> of the first evening of the conference. On this recording Frank O'Connor finishes his talk "The Modern Novel" and Anthony West is invited to respond to Hyman and O'Connor's lectures. Before Collins conscludes the first evening, the panelists discuss what they have heard.
